# Bird_Strikes_Analysis_Project
Welcome to our detailed analysis report of bird strikes between 2000 to 2011. In this report, we will analyze the key highlights of the bird strikes data, unveiling the patterns of aviation safety and wildlife conservation and discuss sustainable measures to protect wildlife.

## Problem Statement:
Transport and communication are in the crucial domain in the field of analytics. Environmental impacts and safety are, nowadays, two major concerns of the scientific community with respect to transport scenarios and to the ever-growing urban areas. These issues gain more importance due to the increasing amount of vehicles and people. Seeking new solutions is reaching a point where available technologies and artificial intelligence, especially MAS, are being recognized as ways to cope with and tackle these kinds of problems in a distributed and more appropriate way.

## My Approach:
The main objective of the project is to provide detailed analysis on bird strikes happened between 2000-2011, to shed light on patterns of bird strikes and access their impact on aviation and wildlife safety.

## Tools Used
- Excel
- Python (Jupyter Notebook) - Data cleansing and graphical visualizations.
- Tableau - Created interactive dashboards to visualize all outcomes.

## Data Collection and Data Cleaning Steps
- The data for bird strikes analysis is collected in excel format.
- Imported necessary libraries in jupyter notebook. Loaded the excel file to the system.
- Checked the duplicated and null values for all the columns of the dataset.
- Replacing/Dropping the null/NA values.
   -Adjusted the dtypes of the date and time columns.
   -Dropped the unnecessary columns from the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis with Python
- After performing cleaning steps, we visualized the plots using seaborn and matplotlib libraries with python. Steps performed in EDA task are:
   - Yearly Analysis of Bird Strikes in US
   - Top 10 US Airlines by Bird Strikes
   - Top 10 Airports by Bird Strikes
   - Yearly Cost Incurred due to Bird Strikes
   - Bird Strikes by Conditions: Precipitations
   - Effect of Bird Strikes & Impact on Flight
   - Effect of Strikes at Different Altitude
   - Prior Warning and Effect of Strike Relation

## Interactive Dashboard in Tableau
- [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kajal.raut/viz/BirdStrikesAnalysisDashboard/Dashboard1)

## Insights and Findings
- The highest no. of Birds strucks on the Airports was DALLAS/FORT WORTH INTL ARPT with an count of "2932", as the bar plot show the other Airports with there birds struck's count.
- Southwest Airlines has encountered most number of bird strikes followed by Business and American Airlines.
- The frequency of bird struck’s on different altitude as the highest count is shown by the altitude <1000 ft with the count of ‘59270’ as compared to when altitude was >1000 ft with the count of ‘8681’. 
- Most of the Damage caused during Climb and Approach phase.
- The impact to the Aircraft was vey less or "Nothing" where as there was few portions shown in the pie chart the impact was caused like "Engine Shut Down, Precautionary Landing & Others” 
- The total no. of birds struck by different weather conditions, the highest no. of birds struck was when the weather condition was "Rain" with the total of "4374" and lowest when "Fog, Snow" with the total of "4".

## Conclusion
Bird Strike is common and can be a significant threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engine ones, are vulnerable to the loss of thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in several fatal accidents. The analysis of bird strike data highlights a critical balance between safety and wildlife conservation. As strikes pose risks to both aircraft and birds, it is imperative to prioritize sustainable practices to protect avian species. Without intervention, we risk not only endangering these species but potentially leading them to extinction. Proactive measures must be taken to safeguard their populations for the ecological balance and the well-being of our shared environment.
