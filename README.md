# Bird_Strikes_Analysis_Project
Welcome to our detailed analysis report of bird strikes between 2000 to 2011. In this report, we will analyze the key highlights of the bird strikes data, unveiling the patterns of aviation safety and wildlife conservation and discuss sustainable measures to protect wildlife.

## Problem Statement:
Transport and communication are in the crucial domain in the field of analytics. Environmental impacts and safety are, nowadays, two major concerns of the scientific community with respect to transport scenarios and to the ever-growing urban areas. These issues gain more importance due to the increasing amount of vehicles and people. Seeking new solutions is reaching a point where available technologies and artificial intelligence, especially MAS, are being recognized as ways to cope with and tackle these kinds of problems in a distributed and more appropriate way.

## My Approach:
The main objective of the project is to provide detailed analysis on bird strikes happened between 2000-2011, to shed light on patterns of bird strikes and access their impact on aviation and wildlife safety.
